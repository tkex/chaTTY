# chaTTY

A (simple) client-server chat application in Java. Built in one of my intro programming class assignments back in University.

# Quick setup

- Clone the repository
- Download and install the JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html
- Optional: Get an IDE like f.e. IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Compile the java files
- Run the server to be able to get connections from clients

# Further information

- The client GUI was made with Swing: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html
- The communication happens locally and over the port 5000. In best case there's no other application (service) using that port already.
